ASSIGNMENT FOR WORDPRESS AND SHOPIFY DEVELOPER

Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to test your understanding of Shopifyâ€™s metafields, Dawn theme 
customization, Liquid templating, and the creation of a customizable theme section. You will be 
required to create a category viewing section using metafields, add additional Liquid 
customizations, and create a customizable theme section for uploading images and content.

Assignment Scope:

Metafield Setup for Product Categories:
- Create a metafield for each product to assign it to a specific category (e.g., "Engagement Rings," 
"Statement Rings," etc.).
- The categories should be assigned using metafields and stored in the product settings.
- Display these categories as boxes with images and text (similar to the provided image) above the 
product listing grid.

Customizing the Dawn Theme:
- Customize the PLP (collection template) in the Dawn theme to display these category boxes.
- Each box should show an image (this can be either a metafield or a default image) and the 
category name.
- When a user clicks on a category box, they should be taken to a filtered view of the products 
belonging to that category.

Creating a Customizable Theme Section:
- Create a new theme section using Liquid that can be customized from the Shopify theme editor.
- This section should allow the admin to upload an image and input content (e.g., text or HTML) 
via the theme customizer.
- The image and content should be displayed dynamically on the PLP page or home page, 
depending on where the section is included.
- Ensure the section is responsive and follows the design consistency of the Dawn theme.

Styling & Layout:
- Ensure that the category boxes follow the layout as per the image provided, keeping the 
responsive design principles in mind.
- Implement hover effects and smooth transitions when hovering over the category boxes to 
enhance the user experience.

Additional Product Customization:
- After the category boxes, the standard product grid should be displayed below.
- Add metafield-driven product details, such as materials, available sizes, or product ratings, below 
the product image in the grid.
- Ensure the product grid remains responsive and consistent with the Dawn theme's design.

Extra Liquid Customization:
- Use Liquid to dynamically pull and display the categories on the PLP.
- Implement a badge system that uses metafields to label products as "New," "Best Seller," or 
"Limited Edition" within the product grid.

Submission Guidelines:
- Create a store on your Shopify Partners account and implement the changes on this store.
- Share the store URL and password (if applicable) for us to access and review your work.
- Optional: Provide a video demo or screenshots.
